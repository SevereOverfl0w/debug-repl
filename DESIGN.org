* Rewrite #4
  - Any thread can call (break!)
  - only the main eval thread is attached to by default?
    - What if you eval (deref (future (break!)))?
    - could attach to it from another repl presumably...
    - things keep getting sent, so the middleware can intercept!
    - format for special commands? #!attach
  - #!unbreak ?
  - What does the middleware track? (per user session ...)
    -
  - Should we do this with a single nrepl session via a thread-pool?
  - How will *1/*2 get managed?
* Rewrite #5
  - Goal: don't modify ANY code until somebody calls (break!)
