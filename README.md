# debug-repl

Inspired by [an older
library](https://github.com/georgejahad/debug-repl), debug-repl is a
debug repl implemented as an nrepl middleware. It allows you to set
breakpoints that cause the execution to stop and switches the repl to
evaluate code in the context of the breakpoint.

## Usage

Add the dependency and the middleware, e.g. in your `:user` profile:

``` clojure
:dependencies [[com.gfredericks/debug-repl "0.0.1"]]
:repl-options
  {:nrepl-middleware
    [com.gfredericks.debug-repl/wrap-debug-repl]}
```

Then when you're ready to set breakpoints:

``` clojure
user> (require '[com.gfredericks.debug-repl :refer [break! unbreak!]])
nil
user> (let [x 41] (break!))
Hijacking repl for breakpoint: unnamed
user> (inc x)
42
user> (unbreak!)
nil
nil
```
